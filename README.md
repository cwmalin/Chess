# Chess
A chess GUI with a computer opponent.
This project was made by Connor Malin and Aidan Noel jointly. Connor Malin wrote the logic, and Aidan Noel wrote the GUI.
It supports castling and promotion.
Bugs include problems with promotion and a massive decrease in computer skill for no obvious reason.
