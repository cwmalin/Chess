# Chess
A chess GUI with a computer opponent.
This project was made by Connor Malin and Aidan Noel jointly in their senior year of high school. Connor Malin wrote the logic, and Aidan Noel wrote the GUI.
It supports castling and promotion.
Bugs include problems with promotion and a massive decrease in computer skill at times for no obvious reason.
